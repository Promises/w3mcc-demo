An example map displaying how to use the features from [w3mcc](https://github.com/cipherxof/w3mcc).

# Setup

1. Download [index.zip](http://wc3maps.com/index.zip)
2. Extract the contents to `Warcraft III\_retail_\webui\`
3. Clone this repository (or download [w3mcc.w3x](https://wc3maps.com/w3mcc.w3x) and skip steps 3 & 4).
4. Run `npm i; npm run test`

Note: If you have w3champions installed you must uninstall before using this. This current method of installation is only for testing purposes as these features have not yet been merged into w3champions.
